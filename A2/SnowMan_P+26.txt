One must have a mind of  great
To regard the frost and the  weather
Of the pine-trees crusted with  pollen
And have been cold a long  journey
To behold the junipers shagged with  green
The spruces rough in the distant  blue
Of the January sun; and not to  sleep
Of any misery in the sound of the  words
In the sound of a few  hours
Which is the sound of the  horn
Full of the same  people
That is blowing in the same bare  light
For the listener, who listens in the  center
And, nothing himself,  really
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that  seems

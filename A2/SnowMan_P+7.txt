One must have a mind of  good
To regard the frost and the  sudden
Of the pine-trees crusted with  dried
And have been cold a long  bit
To behold the junipers shagged with  sharp
The spruces rough in the distant  and
Of the January sun; and not to  get
Of any misery in the sound of the  great
In the sound of a few  lines
Which is the sound of the  waves
Full of the same  and
That is blowing in the same bare  bottom
For the listener, who listens in the  context
And, nothing himself,  that
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that  goes
